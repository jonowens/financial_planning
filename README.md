## License

When you share a project on a repository, especially a public one, it's important to choose the right license to specify others what they can and can not do with your source code and files. Use this section to include the licence you want to use.  If you are not sure about what license you may use for your project, you can use the choosealicense.com website to decide which license fits your interest.
For projects hosted in GitHub, you may read the "Licensing a repository" article on the GitHub help to understand the implications of not choosing a license for your project.
