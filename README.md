## General Information
You have found it!  The following repository helps you visualize your personal savings!

- 1. Do you have enough money as an emergency fund composed of stocks and bonds?
- 2. What is your range of expected 30 year portfolio returns, distributed over stocks and bonds, for retirement?

These tools are amazing and can be dialed to increase or decrease your initial investment along with changing the weighted distribution of portfolio assets using the Jupyter Notebook file titled financial_planner.ipynb.  Enjoy!

### Wait!  There's more.

As a bonus, there is an additional Jupyter Notebook, financial_planner_short_term.ipynb, allowing you to make similar adjustments to your initial investment and weighted portfolio assets.  This tool gives a visual perspect on a 5 year and 10 year scale to help you maximize your returns on a shorter scale, hopefully for earlier retirement!
